# vacfind-db Design Decisions

## Rust
I Picked rust because its something I want to learn. Ive also heard that its highly performant (unlike Python or Node) and is gauranteed not to crash. although im not 100% sure about that last part.




## GraphQL
Also something I want to learn and heavily involved in another project of mine. Also, given the way i'm structuring the DB schema, it seems like there would be a lot of JOIN calls, so it seems like GraphQL would be helpful in grabbing tons of data across many tables in one query.

## SQLite

fits in a file. Requires no hosted database (makes hosting easier when that becomes a thing)
